## About

An R package for managing and analyzing text, created by [Kenneth Benoit](http://kenbenoit.net).
Supported by the European Research Council grant ERC-2011-StG 283794-QUANTESS.


## How to Install

The normal way from CRAN, using your R GUI or 
```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("quanteda") 
```

Or for the latest development version:
```{r eval = FALSE}
# devtools package required to install quanteda from Github 
devtools::install_github("quanteda/quanteda") 
```

Because this compiles some C++ and Fortran source code, you will need to have installed the appropriate compilers.

**If you are using a Windows platform**, this means you will need also to install
the [Rtools](https://CRAN.R-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) software available
from CRAN.  

**If you are using macOS**, you should install the 
[macOS tools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools/), 
namely the Clang 6.x compiler and the GNU Fortran compiler (as **quanteda** requires gfortran to build).
